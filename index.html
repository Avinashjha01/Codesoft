                <div id="logo">Tim Berners-Lee</div>
                 
                  <div id="about"><p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who has changed the course of human history in computer science.
                 In 1989, he proposed a new information management system. Eight months later, he received the first successful communication from a Hypertext Transfer Protocol via the internet.
                 Since then, Berners-Lee’s initial proposal, the World Wide Web, has become a vital part of every household, business, school, and government in the world. In 2012, he received an honor as the official inventor of the internet at the Olympics Opening Ceremony in London. 
                 During the ceremony, he live-tweeted “This is for everyone,” words which were spelled out in LCD lights attached to chairs in the crowd.
                 Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), through which he oversees the internet’s continued development. 
                 He also works with the World Wide Web Foundation.</p></div>

                <div id="logo"> Sergey Brin</div> 
                <div id="about"><p>Sergey Brin is the co-founder of Google. He is an American computer scientist and chief data scientist who emigrated from the Soviet Union at age six.

                  As a Ph.D. student at Stanford University, Brin and his friend, Larry Page, crammed a bunch of cheap computers into their dorm room and developed Brin’s data mining system. The mining system became so popular at Stanford University that the two decided to drop out, rent a garage, and start Google.
                  
                  Since then, Brin’s personal wealth has been estimated at more than $87 billion. The Economist has declared Brin an “Enlightened Man,” which is an appropriate title considering Google’s mission statement has always included the idea that “knowledge is always good, and certainly better than ignorance.” Brin has received many awards and accolades.</p></div>
